 * Something that can hand back a random secret word.

 * project: today words come from a text file, but tomorrow they could come
 * from an array, a database, or a web service - and {@link Hangman} should
 * not have to change at all when that happens. That is the Open/Closed
 * Principle (new word sources can be added without touching {@code Hangman})
 * and the Dependency Inversion Principle ({@code Hangman} depends on this
 * interface, not on file-reading code) working together.
 *
 * <p>{@code throws IOException} is the same, ordinary checked exception you
 * already use for any file reading in Java - no custom exception classes
 * needed.
